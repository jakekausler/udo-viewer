Lot Depth</strong><br>Lot depth is the distance between the front and rear property lines measured along a line midway between the side property lines.</p><div class=\"align-center media media--type-image media--view-mode-default\">\n  \n      \n            <div class=\"field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item\">  <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"64\" height=\"64\" src=\"/sites/default/files/2023-09/1-5-2-d-lot-depth.svg\" alt=\"1-5-2-d-lot-depth.svg\">\n\n</div>\n      \n  </div>\n<p><strong>E.

Density, Lot Area per Dwelling Unit, and Site Area per Dwelling Unit</strong></p><ol><li>Residential density, where applicable, is expressed in units per acre and is calculated by dividing the total number of dwelling units by the gross site area. Unless otherwise specified herein, minimum lot sizes, minimum site areas per dwelling unit, and minimum lot areas per dwelling unit shall be the controlling factors in determining dwelling unit yields.</li><li>Although minimum lot sizes may allow additional units, density, where applicable, serves as the maximum number of principal units per acre.

For any lot developed with a Detached House or a Tiny House or an Attached House in a Frequent Transit Area, two accessory dwelling units are permitted per lot, regardless of underlying density, minimum lot size, minimum lot area per dwelling unit, or minimum site are per dwelling unit designations. For any lot developed with a Townhouse, one accessory dwelling unit is permitted per townhouse lot regardless of underlying density, minimum lot size, minimum lot area per dwelling unit, or minimum site are per dwelling unit designations.</li><li>In residential districts, any area required to be dedicated for public right-of-way by the Comprehensive Plan or any area dedicated as greenway, provided that the dedicators waive their statutory right to withdraw the dedication, may be transferred to contiguous property zoned to allow dwelling units. Transfers are restricted to properties under the same ownership which are located outside any Watershed Protection Area and in the same development as the dedication for right-of-way less than 60 feet in width.</li><li>A map showing the property and right-of-way dedication shall be recorded in the Wake County Registry with an indication that the roadway dedication density allowance has been utilized for the particular property prior to recording any subsequent maps in the development.</li><li>No density, lot area, or site area transfer shall be allowed if the developer has executed a reimbursement contract.</li><li>When a site is partly within a CM District, density, lot area, or site area may be transferred from the CM District, which carries the residential density, lot area, or site area minimums of the contiguous zoning district. If more than 1 zoning district adjoins the CM District, the CM District shall be divided by carrying the boundary lines separating the districts into the CM-zoned area.</li></ol>",

With a view to this distinction, outdoor advertising signs are regulated differently from on-premise signs.

Built-upon area includes but is not limited to roofs, patios, balconies, decks, streets, parking areas, driveways, sidewalks and any concrete, stone, brick, asphalt or compacted gravel surfaces. The effective impervious coverage for certain surfaces listed below are as follows:<ol><li id=\"sec-f-1-a\">Asphalt, concrete, crusher-run gravel, masonry, marl, wood and other impermeable surfaces that prevent land area from infiltrating stormwater are 100% impervious.</li><li id=\"sec-f-1-b\">Porous surfaces that permit direct infiltration of unconcentrated stormwater into ground areas which are prepared in accordance with plans approved by the City so that the first one-half inch of stormwater infiltrates into the ground are 70% through 10% impervious, depending on:<ol><li id=\"sec-f-1-b-i\">Compaction;</li><li id=\"sec-f-1-b-ii\">Condition of subgrade;</li><li id=\"sec-f-1-b-iii\">Extent of land disturbance;</li><li id=\"sec-f-1-b-iv\">Extent of porous openings;</li><li id=\"sec-f-1-b-v\">Protection from siltation and clogging;</li><li id=\"sec-f-1-b-vi\">Slope of the ground area; and</li><li id=\"sec-f-1-b-vii\">Volume of stormwater stored.</li></ol></li><li id=\"sec-f-1-c\">Slatted wood decks that allow the drainage of water through the slats to an unpaved surface below are 50% impervious.

The open space bonus shall be based on a sliding scale factor from 0.9 (10% greater than required buffer) to 0.5 (100% greater than required buffer). The open space credit factor shall be determined as follows: (Area of required natural resource buffer)/(Area of proposed natural resource buffer) = Credit Factor.

The maximum period of delay authorized by this section shall be reduced by the Commission where it finds that the owner would suffer extreme hardship or be permanently deprived of all beneficial use of or return from such property by virtue of the delay. During such period of delay the Commission may negotiate with the owner and with any other parties in an effort to find a means of preserving the building, structure or site.

In the event that the development agreement provides that the City shall provide certain public facilities, the development agreement shall provide that the delivery date of such public facilities will be tied to successful performance by the developer in implementing the proposed development, such as meeting defined completion percentages or other performance standards.</li>\n\t\t\t<li id=\"sec-c-1-e\">A description, where appropriate, of any reservation or dedication of land for public purposes and any provisions agreed to by the developer that exceed existing laws related to protection of environmentally sensitive property.</li>\n\t\t\t<li id=\"sec-c-1-f\">A description, where appropriate, of any conditions, terms, restrictions, or other requirements for the protection of public health, safety, or welfare.</li>\n\t\t\t<li id=\"sec-c-1-g\">A description, where appropriate, of any provisions for the preservation and restoration of historic structures.</li>\n\t\t\t<li id=\"sec-c-1-h\">A specified term of years governing the duration and expiration of the agreement.</li>\n\t\t\t<li id=\"sec-c-1-i\">Identify the adopted plan or adopted CIP project included in the proposed development agreement.</li>\n\t\t</ol>\n\t\t</li>\n\t\t<li id=\"sec-c-2\">A development agreement may also provide that the entire development or any phase of it be commenced or completed within a specified period of time.
